GSMMC 2019

This respository was created for the Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling Camp, held at the University of Deleware from June 12 through June 15, 2019. We are investigating a model describing a drug-infused contact lens deliverng targeted medication to the cornea of the eye. This research builds on past studies on finding more effective treatments for glaucoma.
